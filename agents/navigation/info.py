Sampling Radius = Target veclocity * (1/20) 
Way point should be close to each other.
Way points should be further on increasing target speed. SHould see increase when target speed increases.

^ Try this first. MPC might require more buffer. Talk to Sapan to find out how many way points he needs from Waypoint buffer.
